Revision history for Perl module Protocol::DBus

0.07
- Rename do_authn() to initialize(), and make it return falsy until the
  “Hello” response arrives back. This removes the workflow state where
  authn is done but the connection name is not yet established. I don’t
  believe this should break anything since get_message() never actually
  returned the “Hello” response.
- Rename authn_pending_send() to init_pending_send().
- Added DBUS_COOKIE_SHA1 authentication support.
- Implement fallback when server indicates authn mechanisms
  besides EXTERNAL.
- EXTERNAL authn now attempts to auto-load Socket::MsgHdr except on
  OSes (e.g., Linux, Cygwin) where it’s known not to make a difference.
- Fix parsing of DBus addresses

0.06 Sat 1 Dec 2018
- Socket::MsgHdr is no longer required.
- BREAKING CHANGE: Socket::MsgHdr must now be loaded prior to D-Bus
authentication in order for UNIX FD passing to work.
